---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Fixed Feedback Form Text Contrast** ✅
- **Issue**: Blue-circled text (Category, Message labels) had poor contrast
- **Solution**: Updated all feedback form labels to use sidebar color standards
- **Changes**: `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300` applied throughout settings page
- **File**: `app/settings/page.tsx`

### 2. **List Filter in Word Selection** ✅
- **Issue**: No way to filter words by source list when adding to custom lists
- **Solution**: Feature was ALREADY IMPLEMENTED!
- **Location**: Dropdown in word selection modal on My Lists page
- **Features**:
  - Shows all vocabulary lists and custom lists
  - Filters words by selected list
  - Combines with search functionality
- **File**: `app/my-lists/page.tsx` (lines 600-625)

### 3. **Rich Social Media Preview Cards** ✅
- **Issue**: Shared links only showed plain text, no word card preview
- **Solution**: Created dynamic word pages with Open Graph image generation
- **Implementation**:
  - New route: `/word/[id]` - Individual word page with full details
  - API route: `/api/og` - Generates beautiful OG images (1200x630)
  - Updated share functionality to link to word-specific pages
  - OG images include: word, reading, meaning, and word image
- **Files**:
  - `app/word/[id]/page.tsx` - Word detail page
  - `app/api/og/route.tsx` - OG image generator
  - `components/ShareWordCard.tsx` - Updated share logic

### 4. **Reduced Flashcard Text Size** ✅
- **Issue**: Meaning text on flashcard back was too large
- **Solution**: Changed from `text-6xl` to `text-4xl`
- **Result**: More readable, less overwhelming
- **File**: `app/quiz/flashcard/page.tsx` (line 387)

### 5. **Fixed Flashcard Scoring Bug** ✅ (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Quiz showing 4/5 when all 5 answers were correct
- **Root Cause**: React state batching - `setState` is async, `finishQuiz()` was using stale state
- **Solution**: 
  - Calculate score locally before setState
  - Pass updated score directly to `finishQuiz(newScore)`
  - Modified function signature to accept score parameter
- **Result**: 100% accurate scoring guaranteed
- **File**: `app/quiz/flashcard/page.tsx` (lines 140-210)

### 6. **Removed Share for Custom Words** ✅
- **Issue**: Custom user-added words shouldn't have share functionality
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `word_type` field to Word interface
  - Conditional rendering: `{word.word_type !== 'custom' && <ShareWordCard />}`
- **Result**: Share button only appears for official vocabulary words
- **File**: `components/WordDetailsCard.tsx` (lines 19-23, 165-169)

### 7. **Hidden WordDetailsCard Scrollbar** ✅
- **Issue**: Scrollbar still visible despite previous attempts to hide it
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `.scrollbar-hide` utility class in global CSS
  - Supports all browsers: Chrome/Safari (webkit), Firefox, IE/Edge
  - Applied class to WordDetailsCard modal
- **Files**:
  - `app/globals.css` - Added utility class
  - `components/WordDetailsCard.tsx` - Applied class

### 8. **Fixed Streak Animation** ✅
- **Issue**: Streak animation not showing after quiz completion
- **Root Cause**: localStorage check prevented showing animation more than once per day
- **Solution**: Removed date check - animation now shows after every quiz
- **Result**: Celebration popup appears every time streak updates
- **File**: `app/quiz/results/page.tsx` (lines 23-36)

### 9. **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)** ✅ (MAJOR FEATURE)

#### Features Implemented:
1. **Database Schema** (`lib/supabase/srs-schema.sql`):

   - SM-2 algorithm function: `calculate_next_review()`
   - Progress update function: `update_srs_progress()`
   - Due words counter: `get_due_words_count()`

   - Fetches words due for review (based on `next_review_date`)
   - Shows word image, kanji/romaji, pronunciation button

     - **Easy** (Blue) - ~2 weeks (SM-2 calculated with bonus)
   - Progress bar shows session progress
   - Real-time session stats tracker

5. **SM-2 Algorithm Details**:

   - Intervals: 1 day → 6 days → calculated exponentially
   - Quality < 3 (Again/Hard): Resets to learning mode
   - Quality ≥ 3 (Good/Easy): Progressive intervals
   - Mastery: Achieved at 7+ repetitions with ease ≥ 2.5

### 10. **Quiz Results Word List** ✅
