# Lexora - Recent Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues (Latest Update)

### 1. Example Readings in Word Details Card
**Issue**: Couldn't see the regular kanji reading for examples.

**Fixed**: Updated `components/WordDetailsCard.tsx`
- Examples now display vertically stacked:
  1. **Kanji** (example.example) - Regular Japanese writing
  2. **Furigana** - Hiragana reading above
  3. **Romaji** - Romanized pronunciation
  4. **Translation** - English meaning
- Each element styled distinctly for clarity
- Dark mode support included

**Test**: Open any word details card and check the examples section.

### 2. Dark Mode Not Working Globally
**Issue**: Dark mode toggle only affected settings page, rest of app stayed in light mode.

**Fixed**: Added dark mode classes to all main pages and components:
- ‚úÖ `app/page.tsx` - Home page (All Words)
- ‚úÖ `app/lists/page.tsx` - Vocabulary Lists page
- ‚úÖ `app/settings/page.tsx` - Settings page (already had it)
- ‚úÖ `components/WordDetailsCard.tsx` - Word details modal
- ‚úÖ `components/WordListItem.tsx` - Word cards

**Changes Made**:
- Backgrounds: Added `dark:from-gray-900 dark:via-gray-800 dark:to-gray-900`
- Text: Added `dark:text-white`, `dark:text-gray-300`, `dark:text-gray-400`
- Cards: Added `dark:bg-gray-800`, `dark:bg-gray-700`
- Borders: Added `dark:border-gray-600`, `dark:border-gray-700`
- Buttons/Hover states: Added dark variants

**How Theme Works**:
1. `ThemeContext` manages theme state (light/dark)
2. Theme saved to `user_profiles.settings.theme` in database
3. Theme applies `.dark` class to `document.documentElement`
4. Tailwind's `dark:` variants activate automatically
5. All pages now have dark mode classes

**Test**: 
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Toggle dark mode
2. Navigate to home page, lists page - should all be dark
3. Refresh page - theme should persist
4. Open word details card - should be dark
5. Log out and back in - theme should be remembered

### 3. Avatar Upload RLS Policy Error
**Issue**: "new row violates row-level security policy" error when uploading avatar.

**Root Cause**: File path structure didn't match RLS policy expectations
- **Before**: `avatars/${userId}-${timestamp}.ext` 
- **RLS Expected**: `{userId}/{filename}` (with userId as folder)

**Fixed**: Updated `app/profile/page.tsx`
- **Now**: `${userId}/${timestamp}.ext`
- File structure: `avatars/{userId}/{filename}`
- Matches RLS policy: `auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`

**Updated Documentation**: 
- `SUPABASE-SETUP-GUIDE.md` now shows correct structure
- Added DELETE policy for users to remove their own avatars

**Test**:
1. Go to Profile page
2. Click avatar upload
3. Select an image
4. Should upload successfully
5. Check Supabase Storage ‚Üí avatars ‚Üí should see folder with your user ID
6. Avatar should display immediately

);
