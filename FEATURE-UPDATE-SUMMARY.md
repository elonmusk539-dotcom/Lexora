### 4. Due Words Prioritization
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Changes Made:**
- Updated Smart Quiz to accept query parameters (duration, lists)

// Prioritization Logic:
1. Get due words from user_progress where next_review_date ≤ today
2. Filter to only include words from selected lists
3. If more words needed, fetch new/future words from selected lists
4. Combine: [...dueWords, ...newWords]

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Linting Issues
- Multiple `<img>` tags should use Next.js `<Image>` component (performance optimization)
- Some React Hook useEffect missing dependencies (functional but could be cleaner)
- Apostrophes in JSX should be escaped (cosmetic)

**Impact:** None - these are code quality suggestions, not functional bugs

### Database Query Optimization
- Current prioritization does multiple queries (can be optimized with joins)
- Consider caching due words count for better performance

**Impact:** Low - acceptable performance for current scale
