## üéØ Features Completed

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Theme Toggle Issue

**Problem:** Users couldn't switch between light and dark themes - the app was stuck in one mode.

**Solution:**
- Modified `contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` to:
  - Initialize theme from localStorage or system preference on load
  - Save theme to localStorage immediately when changed
  - Apply theme to DOM synchronously (no delays)
  - Load user's saved theme preference from database asynchronously

**Files Modified:**
- `contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Initialize from localStorage or system preference
const [theme, setThemeState] = useState<Theme>(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') as Theme | null;
    if (savedTheme) return savedTheme;
    if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
      return 'dark';
    }
  }
  return 'light';
});
```
